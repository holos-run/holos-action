# Holos Render Action

This GitHub Action executes the `holos render platform` command in your workflow
to render your platform configuration.  Useful to fully render configuration
manifests when configuration code, or input data chances.

For an example of Kargo automatically bumping the version of add-ons and
submitting pull requests, see the documentation on the [Holos Kargo
integration](https://holos.run/docs/kargo/).
